                      the last year (1990) Atari has never been far from the headlines 
                      with a series of major releases and controversial 
                      problems. Bob Gleadow, Atari UK's managing director, is 
                      the driving force behind the British end of the company, 
                      and Colin Campbell (New Computer Express) went to meet 
                      him...<br>
                      <br>
                      Atari's ST, while far from the autumn of its years, has 
                      reached the safety of middle age. It is neither state of 
                      the art, nor outdated junk - but it has passed its prime 
                      as an admired piece of hardware. With characteristic savvy 
                      its maker and guardian has performed the necessary 
                      transition with common sense. That is, to position the 
                      machine not as a bright new thing for the computer 
                      literate, but as a no-nonsense entry level option for the 
                      masses that have yet to fully comprehend that there's more 
                      to computing than bytes, floppies and Pacman.<br>
                      <br>
                      Atari would rather be selling computers than positioning 
                      them in some grand scheme.&nbsp; But position it it must 
                      in order to introduce the five year-old ST to what 
                      continues to be the most important person in home 
                      computing - the first-time buyer.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>:: TOP MAN ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      Bob Gleadow, for the past three years Atari UK's top man, 
                      is fronting the operation.&nbsp; He's not just the 
                      managing director of Britain's sales operation, but more 
                      significantly, a touchstone for the decision makers in 
                      Sunnyvale, California.&nbsp; With the UK so important to 
                      Atari Corp, his performance is vital.<br>
                      <br>
                      His ruffled hair and amiable manner belie a wolf-like 
                      approach to business that incorporates aggression with a 
                      subtlety that opposite numbers lack. Like most businessmen 
                      he says &quot;we like to think we can afford to be nice&quot;, but 
                      he'd rather like to think he can thrash his competitors if 
                      he has to.<br>
                      <br>
                      He is most certainly faster at making decisions than his 
                      adversaries, but this can have an unpleasant effect. 
                      Buyers of the STE - shipped-in at short notice last 
                      December to cope with yet another Christmas shortage - 
                      will testify to this.<br>
                      <br>
                      It was Gleadow who picked up the telephone and dragged the 
                      computers into Britain when seasonal demand and a dock 
                      strike threatened to mangle up sales plans. And, despite 
                      predictable compatibility problems, he'd probably do the 
                      same again. But his immediate concern does not centre on 
                      supplying demand - more with generating it. Bargain 
                      hunters may be Pleased to learn that this will be achieved 
                      through the ST Discovery Pack.<br>
                      <br>
                      Bundles are bundles are bundles, and they are usually 
                      cobbled together with a degree of sales cynicism. Atari is 
                      no less guilty of that than any other company, but this 
                      time there appears to be a genuine attempt to give people 
                      what they really want: a good computer, a guiding hand, 
                      and some freebies to boot.<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;What we want to do this year is position the 520ST as a 
                      first-time buyer's machine with a £299 price point. We're 
                      trying to separate out the first-time buyer and the 
                      second-time buyer - one with an attractive £299 package, 
                      and the other at £499 where we'll actually look to sell 
                      the 1040.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      This may smack of marketing mumbo-jumbo, but therein sits 
                      the future of one of Europe's most popular home computers. 
                      Gleadow is no longer content to fight it out with the 
                      Amiga - he's now after those people who would normally be 
                      wondering whether an Amstrad CPC would be better than a 
                      Spectrum or Commodore 64 etc.<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;It's a better deal. When you buy an 8-bit computer you 
                      still have to look at a disk drive and other extras. With 
                      the 520 you're getting a superior machine with a 1Mb disk 
                      drive and access to a wide range of software packages.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>:: POINT TAKEN ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      He has a point. Buy a tape-driven CPC and you're looking 
                      at £299. Buy one with a disk drive and that's £399. The 
                      Spectrum isn't much better. A Plus 3 will cost £100 less 
                      than the ST - but it's largely based on a computer 
                      introduced almost 10 years ago.<br>
                      <br>
                      It has to be noted that the ST has been selling for £299 
                      for ages. But people don't simply want a piece of 
                      hardware, they want a fully-fledged computing option, 
                      hence the new emphasis. The 520 ST is no longer in a 
                      head-to-head battle with the Amiga. It's an alternative to 
                      the 8-bits. At least that's the theory.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>:: GLEADOW ON THE STE ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;We released the STE prematurely. We brought in 20,000 
                      last December and they all sold through. The justification 
                      for our doing that was that there was a dock strike at 
                      Folkestone Harbour and we had to fly them in,&quot; says 
                      Gleadow.&nbsp; This isn't exactly saying 'sorry we did 
                      wrong', but it is something of a departure from the 
                      arrogant attitude displayed when the STE compatibility 
                      fiasco was in full swing.<br>
                      <br>
                      Then, when leading ST software packages were not running 
                      on the upgrade, Atari was adamant that it could not be 
                      held responsible for the follies of over ambitious 
                      programmers who saw fit to break the rules on earlier 
                      models. Nevertheless, these follies are well known to all 
                      in computing and really should have been added to the 
                      formula.<br>
                      <br>
                      Gleadow explains: &quot;we all know that programmers take short 
                      cuts. The problem was that they were violating Atari 
                      guidelines. The problem with the Atari guidelines is that 
                      you could go round them with one version of a product with 
                      no problem. But of course when Atari comes to do the next 
                      version it takes those guidelines as the Bible and sticks 
                      to them. That's how we guarantee compatibility.&quot;&nbsp; 
                      Except of course, in the event, real-world compatibility 
                      could not be guaranteed.<br>
                      <br>
                      Whatever, the wails of &quot;I should have bought an Amiga 
                      after all' from disgruntled buyers have floated away. 
                      Software publishers are failing into line, and with the 
                      STE now priced at £100 more than the STFM; Atari is saying 
                      that those 20,000 buyers can count themselves pretty 
                      lucky.<br>
                      <br>
                      The STE is a 'serious' computer'.&nbsp; &quot;You can upgrade 
                      it to almost anything you want. 4Mb packs are already 
                      available from third-party dealers, proving that there is 
                      a market demand for the serious user.&quot;&nbsp; The STE costs 
                      serious money. Atari is deliberately steering prospective 
                      purchasers toward the £499 option with extra goodies. One 
                      suspects the basic £399 model will not be one of Atari's 
                      big sellers this year.<br>
                      <br>
                      But is the STE an 'Amiga beater'?&nbsp; &quot;I never said it 
                      was,&quot; he replies. &quot;It's an improvement on the existing 
                      machine.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>:: GLEADOW ON BUSINESS ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;Over the last two or three years Atari has become a 
                      mufti-product manufacturer. By the end of this year you'll 
                      see Atari being successful in consoles, with the Lynx, in 
                      business machines and there will be the beginnings of a 
                      workstation presence. So as we have evolved over the last 
                      three years we have had to change our style.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      With such a broad range of gadgets and computers within 
                      his remit, it's no wonder Gleadow is looking to &quot;be in the 
                      background&quot;. When he started at Atari, life was a good 
                      deal simpler. But now he's controlling everything from 
                      games software in the ARC division, through old consoles, 
                      the new ST console (still pencilled in for the autumn), 
                      Lynx hand-held, Portfolio pocket PC, and all the ST's, as 
                      well as the forthcoming TT, a line up of PCs and the top 
                      end ATW Transputer Workstation.<br>
                      <br>
                      With that kind of job spec its no wonder he has to leave 
                      the nitty gritty to employees. But how much of what we see 
                      is dreamt up by the boss? &quot;A degree of that does happen 
                      but before we do anything we get a group of people 
                      together and have what I call a 'bullshit session' &quot;.&nbsp; 
                      &quot;We look at what we're putting together, what we're asking 
                      people to buy, and we throw ideas at each other.&nbsp; 
                      &quot;Ultimately though, I have the casting vote.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      The best thing about being the boss of a hardware 
                      operation is, he says, the salary, but pay cheques tend to 
                      demand a lot of graft. &quot;I think so. When I come in every 
                      morning I think I'm going to be leaving at six o'clock, 
                      but the hours tend to drag on.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      He considers his greatest success at Atari to be the 
                      firm's current standing. But what of his biggest regret? 
                      Surprisingly it's in that area where the ST has really 
                      proved its worth as a serious tool - desktop publishing. 
                      Gleadow says he should have moved faster two years ago 
                      when DTP was still more of a buzzword than a reality. &quot;We 
                      should have recognised the capabilities of the ST in DTP 
                      early on.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      Gleadow views it as a real alternative to the Apple Mac 
                      rather than being the poor imitation some have suggested 
                      (including the market in general). But he sees the TT as 
                      &quot;my second chance to get into DTP and graphics&quot;.<br>

                      <b>:: GLEADOW ON THE COMPETITION ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      Much is made of the rivalry between Commodore and the firm 
                      it spawned - Atari. Behind the scenes you can just imagine 
                      Gleadow grinning every time Commodore (or indeed Amstrad) 
                      fumbles the ball.<br>
                      <br>
                      And of course Mr Franklin (Commodore) and Mr Sugar 
                      (Amstrad) will also have a good chuckle when Atari trips 
                      over its own ambitions. Such is the nature of intense 
                      competition - but you'll never get any of them to admit 
                      it. &quot;It never crosses my mind. Every step we take is to 
                      look at what we think is good for us in the market. We're 
                      not interested in what everyone else is doing because we 
                      don't have their logic.&quot; A little dig there. Gleadow then 
                      goes on to claim that Commodore is obsessed with Atari.<br>
                      <br>
                      And Amstrad? &quot;The minute Atari starts looking at what 
                      Amstrad is doing and we follow that, we immediately 
                      relegate ourselves to being behind Amstrad, because we're 
                      looking at what he does. Instead we are looking at what we 
                      can do that is good for us.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;If you're in a car race and you start to follow someone, 
                      or you look in the mirror and see what everyone else is 
                      doing, then it starts to distract you from driving as fast 
                      as you can.&nbsp; We're into driving as fast as we can&quot;.&nbsp; 
                      But surely you can't ignore your competitors? &quot;There's 
                      nothing they can do which specifically influences anything 
                      we do. It might cause us not to do something. For 
                      instance, if we were planning a headline and then Amstrad 
                      went out and did it before us, then we would scrap it, 
                      that kind of thing.&quot;<br>

                      <b>:: GLEADOW ON CD ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      Given that Atari introduced a CD-ROM device three years 
                      ago, it may come as a surprise that Gleadow does not share 
                      the enthusiasm expressed by much of the market.<br>
                      <br>
                      When will we see Atari introduce an all-in-one CD ST 
                      device akin to the much-publicised Amiga machine? After 
                      all, isn't CD where it's all happening?&nbsp; 'Is Compact 
                      Disc happening?&quot; You're looking at a man who has had 
                      Compact Disc players (CDAR-504) in his warehouse for 18 
                      months now. Where is the software commitment? Show me a CD 
                      standard. Is it CD-i?<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;Look at the MSX. That had a Laserdisc, which gave you the 
                      best graphics I've seen. It was true video with a computer 
                      image superimposed. Outside of Japan it didn't do very 
                      well...&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      He turns on the notion of CD/computer combos. &quot;They're 
                      going to cost £600 or £700. How big is the market 
                      opportunity at that price range? We think computer buyers 
                      should become CD buyers. Its better to offer computer 
                      buyers the CD as an extra rather than offering a 
                      highly-priced integrated system.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>:: GLEADOW ON THE PRESS ::</b><br>
                      <br>
                      While Commodore and Amstrad generally like to wait for 
                      things to happen before announcing them, Atari is 
                      constantly toying with the press - hinting, leaking, 
                      suggesting and otherwise making implications. It sometimes 
                      moves into the realms of absurdity, although for those 
                      with a vested interest in information (like magazine news 
                      editors) it's all rather jolly.<br>
                      <br>
                      Uniquely, Atari isn't so much concerned with the public's 
                      perception of it as a company, rather with the perception 
                      of each individual project.&nbsp; This has the effect of 
                      providing magazine readers with lots of juicy titbits from 
                      &quot;highly placed sources&quot; as well as supplying Atari's 
                      formidable PR machine with cheap market research.&nbsp; 
                      Doesn't this take, well, a certain degree of manipulation 
                      of the press? Gleadow is suitably shocked at such a 
                      suggestion. &quot;I wish we could manipulate the press,&quot; he 
                      jests.&nbsp; And he is jesting.<br>
