        <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;Business is war - I don't 
        believe in compromising. I believe in winning.&quot; Jack Tramiel</font></i></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Many people are critical of the Tramiel 
        family.&nbsp; They blame the family for the downfall of the company and 
        don't have many positive things to say about them in general.&nbsp; Why 
        have they been treated this way by so many?&nbsp; Is there any truth to 
        these suggestions of incompetence or greed?&nbsp; I want to share with 
        you a basic insight into the Tramiel business ethic, some of the main 
        areas of concern that many believe didn't help the company and in 
        closing, end with my personal feelings.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">To understand the Tramiel business 
        philosophy is the simple part.&nbsp; Jack Tramiel in particular had a 
        war like attitude to doing business, and he was very open about this.&nbsp; 
        He had a black and white approach to his business model; sell more to 
        the customer at a price he/she is prepared to pay.&nbsp; Listening to 
        interviews and reading articles about Jack Tramiel you quickly build up 
        a picture of a man who has steadfastly stuck to his business principles 
        for his entire career.&nbsp; He is not a man that would easily change 
        his plans once he had decided upon his chosen path, and more 
        importantly, this shows a belief in himself that many other mortals 
        would find difficult to muster.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">It is this, near stubborn quality, that has 
        enabled Jack Tramiel to be a successful business man, and some of this 
        can also be attributed to the, how should we say, errors of judgement he 
        has perhaps been responsible for, either directly or indirectly, at 
        Atari Corp.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Jack Tramiel was responsible for one of the 
        most prestigious computer companies of the late 70's and 80's, and that 
        company was Commodore Business Machines.&nbsp; It is through his reign 
        at CBM, we can see some of the traits he brought to bare on Atari which 
        he took over in 1984.&nbsp; For example, After the acquisition of MOS 
        Technologies in 1976, he couldn't believe the amount of R&amp;D expenditure, 
        which was supporting over 200 separate projects.&nbsp; He quickly set 
        about slashing these budgets and cancelling almost all non-essential 
        projects, streamlining his new subsidiary to concentrate on chip 
        production for his calculator range and his new venture, building a 
        micro-computer.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="center">
        <img border="0" src="images/CBM-MOS-Sign.gif" width="221" height="102"></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Jack was responsible for taking the chance 
        to diversify CBM into the world of micro-computers.&nbsp; It was a 
        gamble that soon paid off, with the launch of the PET (Personal 
        Electronic Transactor) at the end of 1976.&nbsp; By 1984, CBM's sales 
        were close to a Billion Dollars.&nbsp; Jack Tramiel would soon leave the 
        company he had worked so hard to build, after a boardroom battle, which 
        to this day is still somewhat of a mystery.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Jack must have been in a solemn mood after 
        this crossing of swords within the inner sanctum of CBM, after all, 
        this was a company of his own design, and now it had been taken from 
        him.&nbsp; Still, this is where we see the true grit of the man.&nbsp; 
        He planned a return, and decided to bide his time while he looked for a 
        vehicle for his next project.&nbsp; Jack founded a company called TTL 
        (Tramiel Technology Ltd) which would be a holding company for his next 
        acquisition.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Now, Atari at this time (1984) was the thorn 
        in the side of Warner Communications Inc.&nbsp; It was bleeding its 
        parent company dry, and Warner needed to dump the company quickly.&nbsp; 
        1984 was a self-made meltdown of the once buoyant video games market 
        which had started in 1972 with the inception of the worlds first 
        commercially successful video arcade game, PONG.&nbsp; The video games 
        crash was partly Atari's fault, and retailers and customers alike, had 
        been overwhelmed by too many systems and too many games, many of which 
        were expensive and poorly made.&nbsp; The market had been flooded, and 
        product was sitting on the shelves with no homes to go to.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Jack Tramiel realised that although video 
        games were going through a rough patch, the market for micro-computers 
        was still in its infancy, and growing far quicker than most other 
        industry sectors.&nbsp; Jack knew he wanted to compete with his former 
        company, but he needed not only a product to ship to the market, but a 
        recognisable brand name to launch it, otherwise he would need to spend 
        additional money and time building brand awareness.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Its almost of Hollywood proportions, but 
        Jack Tramiel would buy Atari, CBM's former competitor, and begin 
        building a rival to challenge the very company he founded.&nbsp; Not 
        only would Jack initiate a purchase agreement with Warner 
        Communications, that today, would seem farcical, but he would launch a 
        new computer to the market within Six months of his takeover.&nbsp; The 
        basis of Jacks purchase of Atari, was a promissory note and a number of 
        purchase obligations.&nbsp; Remember, Warner were desperate to offload 
        Atari, and this played into the hands of any smart investor willing to 
        take a long term risk.&nbsp; Warner even provided additional loans to 
        the new Atari Corporation amounting to $25 Million.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Looking more closely at this purchase &quot;deal&quot;, 
        it took nearly 2 years for an evaluation of the assets to be determined, 
        so a true value could be negotiated between the two parties (although 
        Warner would receive&nbsp; accrued interest on the final purchase price 
        at 17% during this period).&nbsp; It is also interesting to note that 
        the official price released in June 1984 for the purchase was $240 
        Million, the final figure was much closer to about $95 Million, which 
        was mostly paid for through the sale of Atari stock to Warner, and a 
        once off payment of $36 Million for certain assets and loans in late 
        1986.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Whatever your personal feelings of the 
        Tramiels, the purchase of Atari was a culmination of some smart work, 
        and it also gave Warner a quick and clean way to get the debt ridden 
        company off its books.&nbsp; Warner even paid some of the outstanding 
        and substantial&nbsp; Atari debts itself, this included huge inventories 
        passed onto the new Atari Corporation, estimated to be in the region of 
        over $250 Million, which is why to this day, you can still buy new boxed 
        Atari software with the WCI logo on it... </font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Jack Tramiel took over only the domestic 
        side of Atari Inc, leaving certain properties such as the Arcade 
        Division, and the new Advanced Telephones Systems Division with Warner.&nbsp; 
        The Tramiels' began straight away by clearing the decks - Atari was a 
        monster of a company under Warner Communications, it employed over 
        10,000 people, had over 100 physical properties worldwide, including 80 
        offices and facilities in Sunnyvale, California alone.&nbsp; In order to 
        make the new Atari anything other than a viable proposition, serious 
        cuts in personnel and assets had to be made.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">By the end of 1985, ~1,600 employees were 
        now working for Atari, and it was shipping a new computer system called 
        the Atari 520ST.&nbsp; In order for Jack Tramiel to physically ship a 
        new computer system to end users within 12 months of his takeover, many 
        painful and not so painful decisions had to be made.&nbsp; This is not 
        incompetence, nor is this greed.&nbsp; It clearly showed how to turn a 
        loss-making behemoth into a streamlined and&nbsp; cleverly operated 
        business, and showed the market just how serious the new Atari was, 
        which paved the way for Atari to re-launch itself to the market and 
        raise additional money for expansion.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">After selling nearly all of its Warner 
        manufactured stock, and re-launching a new line of 8-bit computers (or 
        at least cost-effective versions of the older Warner-made computers), 
        Atari had raised enough money to survive until the end of 1985.&nbsp; 
        Through the stock option plan in 1986, Atari would have a healthier 
        balance sheet, and was also obliged to carry out its plans to its new 
        shareholders.&nbsp; These plans included new ST computers, new 8-Bit 
        systems and additional products based on new technologies, which Atari 
        promised to provide to the market at the lowest possible prices.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">In the Tramiels favour, depending on your 
        point of view, Atari was saved in 1984.&nbsp; It wasn't the ideal 
        solution, many good people lost their jobs, and many exciting projects 
        within Atari had to be shelved, but this was the price that had to be 
        paid (bluntly speaking from a purely business perspective).&nbsp; 
        Of course, Warner could have done a lot of things differently and you 
        could assume that if the right choices had been taken earlier, perhaps 
        Atari could have survived?</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Credit where credit is due.&nbsp; Atari was 
        still in business, and within 2 years made a profit of $44 Million.&nbsp; 
        In the face of severe market competition, the Tramiels had to sell 
        enormous amounts of Warner's inventory, as much as 95% of Atari Corps 
        early sales are attributed to this.&nbsp; By the end of 1985, Atari had 
        a new range of products, the market was excited and end users were very 
        happy with their new machines.&nbsp; So, where did all the animosity 
        come from, what happened to taint the Tramiels with the ultimate 
        downfall of Atari?</font></p>

        critical acclaim, and initial sales were strong, enabling Atari Corp to 
        prove itself to the market place and end users.&nbsp; It changed the 
        perception of the Atari brand, and critically, was launched ahead of the 
        more expensive Commodore Amiga, and at a better price/performance point 
        in comparison to the Apple Macintosh and IBM compatibles.</font></p>

        market leading position did not last long.&nbsp; The ST architecture 
        didn't change until late 1989, 4 years after its launch, and although OS 
        and cosmetic changes took place, the product did not evolve quickly 
        enough.&nbsp; This would not have been such an issue if the new ST 
        (launched as the STE - E for Enhanced) had been a significant 
        advancement of the existing platform, but it was not the case.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <i><font face="Arial" size="2">We should point out however, that the 
        computer market at this time wasn't as we now it today.&nbsp; Today's PC 
        runs from a Microsoft (or to a lesser extent, Linux) platform, and 
        manufacturers design PC's through industrial standards and third-party 
        &quot;add-on&quot; product lines.&nbsp; Those of you who have been fortunate 
        enough to experience the personal computer market of the 80's and early 
        90's will be split into two camps; those who enjoyed having a broader 
        range of platforms to choose from, and in turn, could experience 
        different system/software capabilities from a choice of suppliers and 
        the other camp who preferred the standardisation in both hardware and 
        software platforms.&nbsp; Today, its basically a choice between a PC 
        &quot;box&quot; or an Apple &quot;box&quot;.&nbsp; Its also true to say that some people are 
        just plain critical no matter what the choice!</font></i></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <i><font face="Arial" size="2">You could also be of the opinion that 
        Intel, Microsoft and the OEM's have stunted competition, technological 
        advancement and more importantly, consumer choice.&nbsp; After all, the 
        PC isn't radically different to the ST, Amiga or Apple platforms of old, 
        and is overly complicated in its design, especially to new users.&nbsp; 
        It was much easier to use an ST for the first time, and was less 
        intimidating in its approach, compared to today's PC.</font></i></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">During the launch of any new product, new platforms 
        need time to get a foothold, and the ST and its competitors systems 
        also needed time to mature in their respective markets.&nbsp; 
        Unfortunately, the ST could &quot;possibly&quot; have been one of today's 
        &quot;standard&quot; platforms if it wasn't for the lack of development and 
        marketing.&nbsp; The STE should have been a lot more, instead it was a 
        computer system that cosmetically looked the same, and 
        technically, lacked any enhancements that played so well to the market 
        during its maiden launch in 1985.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, a lot of this is purely 
        speculation.&nbsp; But the facts are that the ST should have been 
        continually advanced through a strategic development roadmap.&nbsp; We 
        do know that Atari R&amp;D was working on 32-Bit computers as early as 1986, 
        and that development was taking pace, but unfortunately these developments 
        were too little, too late.&nbsp; The ST was aging fast, and the PC 
        market was advancing in leaps and bounds.&nbsp; Atari had limited 
        budgets compared to the much larger PC multinationals, and it was 
        carrying a proprietary platform on its own.&nbsp; Atari tried launching 
        PC's as well and Commodore became a leading PC supplier in the late 
        80's, in fact, only Apple stuck to its guns and continued stubbornly 
        along its proprietary path (although, Apple survived!).</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Atari did have success with the ST, that 
        cannot be denied. Europe in particular became the cash cow, and Germany 
        became Atari's single biggest market.&nbsp; But the PC manufacturers 
        marched on, as prices continued to fall and big business' wanted to 
        standardise their IT systems.&nbsp; The Multi-tasking PC was the 
        computer of choice for most companies by the end of the 80's, and this was also helped 
        along by Intel and Microsoft.&nbsp; As early as 1990, Atari must have seen the 
        dark clouds forming over its comparatively small market share, and its 
        ability to take on the &quot;big boys&quot; wasn't even financially viable, never 
        mind technologically.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">If Atari had carried its fight from the 
        launch of the ST, and concentrated on a more aggressive long-term 
        strategy, perhaps it could have carved an Apple-like niche in the 
        market.&nbsp; What pains end-users of the ST the most, is knowing that 
        the platform was viable from day one, and it had a strong presence in many areas, 
        specifically as a home computer, as a cost effective DTP platform and 
        especially in the music industry where it held an enviable position as 
        the music computer of choice.&nbsp; We can only ask one question of 
        Atari, &quot;did they actually know this too&quot;?</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">It didn't help that Atari shouted about new 
        products months, sometimes years before their launch.&nbsp; The TT030 
        for example, which was launched in Germany in 1989, could have been the 
        platform to take the DTP market by storm, it could have been the Unix 
        platform of choice.&nbsp; But again, it was delayed even after its 
        &quot;official&quot; launch, and although it had limited success in Europe, Atari 
        let down its domestic market once more by failing to pass its computer 
        products in a timely fashion through FCC certification.&nbsp; The TT030 
        is just one product that &quot;could have been&quot; for Atari, and it wasn't the 
        last.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Another problem, and probably the most 
        talked about, was Atari's failure to market its products in such a way 
        as to actually promote interest in them.&nbsp; That's not to say Atari 
        didn't market its products, it was the way it was done.&nbsp; Jack 
        Tramiel in particular wasn't a friend of the marketing department, he 
        was of the old school of business, and felt that his products sold 
        themselves because of the price and performance they offered to the 
        consumer.&nbsp; He wasn't alone with this philosophy, Ken Olsen of 
        Digital Equipment (another high-tech brand now part of history) didn't 
        recognise advertising as a forum to promote his products or to increase 
        sales, in fact, Digital's marketing departments were hidden away within 
        the company until the mid-eighties before pressure was brought to bare 
        by other board members.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The ST was purchased by consumers who either 
        had an older Atari computer, or through the influence of the independent 
        computer magazines and journals.&nbsp; Outside of this arena, many 
        potential consumers just didn't know of the machines existence, and were 
        unaware of its power and price.&nbsp; When Atari did advertise, it was 
        usually sporadic and through the wrong media.&nbsp; It didn't help that 
        the economic climate was poor compared to today, but even taking 
        consumer spending into account, Atari could have spent more dollars to 
        ensure a potentially higher return.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="center">
        <img border="0" src="images/Federated-logo.gif" width="210" height="46"></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Support and distribution was a constant 
        struggle for Atari.&nbsp; It is fair to say that these are common 
        challenges for any company, but it was Atari's domestic market that 
        would be most challenged in this respect.&nbsp; Atari tried in vain to 
        &quot;buy&quot; market presence through the controversial purchase in 1987 of the 
        &quot;Federated Stores&quot; chain, only to sell it off again in 1990.&nbsp; While 
        most Atari computer shipments from their Taiwan facility were directed 
        to the hungry shores of Europe, Atari distributors in the U.S. could 
        only hope that Atari HQ in Sunnyvale would soon wake-up and take their 
        own domestic market seriously, otherwise the already dwindling dealer 
        network would be reduced to a handful of specialist stores.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Atari was a family run company.&nbsp; The 
        Tramiel's held more than 45% of the stock, and this would become a 
        serious issue for senior management when it came to&nbsp; decision 
        making and department autonomy.&nbsp; The attrition rate of senior 
        management at Atari was legendary, it would have been easier for Jack 
        Tramiel to install a revolving door in each of his senior managers 
        offices.&nbsp; It was that bad.&nbsp; There is a saying; &quot;You live by 
        the sword, you die by the sword&quot;, (you've probably heard this if you've 
        ever worked in sales!), but that was a physical fact of life if you 
        tried to impose, or dictate a strategy or plan that the Tramiels were 
        opposed to.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">This constant shake-up within Atari also had 
        a negative effect outside of the company.&nbsp; Morale is critical to 
        the well-being of a company, and when those all too familiar e-mails 
        contain the words &quot;has left to pursue a new career and we all wish 
        he/she well for the future&quot; begin to become a regular occurrence, it 
        isn't helpful to the staff, the company image, and ultimately the 
        confidence of the consumer and the wider market place.&nbsp; There were 
        many famous names that had walked through the corridors of power in 
        Sunnyvale, some of these figures had ultimately been seen as the 
        saviours of&nbsp; Atari's future, and they were extremely well received 
        by the user groups and developers still hoping the tide would change for 
        the company.&nbsp; But even those high profile names such as Elie Kenan and 
        Tedd Hoff failed to change the mindsets of the Tramiel family.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps the most heart-breaking aspect to 
        the Tramiel rap-sheet is the wasted opportunity that was their 
        possession of 
        the  Atari brand itself.&nbsp; In essence, the famous Fuji icon was best 
        known for gaming, and this was one market that the Tramiels could never 
        understand.&nbsp; Jack Tramiel had made his position clear in 1984, 
        that he wasn't interested in gaming products, and that Atari was a 
        computer company.&nbsp; Atari had a perfectly good product in 1984 with 
        the Warner/GCC designed 7800 Pro System, but this was left on the shelf 
        until 1986, after Nintendo of Japan began to make inroads with its new 
        Nintendo Entertainment System.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">It is true that Atari Corp. had enough on 
        its plate trying to become a successful computer company, but it seems 
        that it continued to respond to Nintendo and Sega with knee-jerk 
        reactions.&nbsp; Atari wasted a golden opportunity with the 7800, and 
        repeated this with the Lynx and to some extent, the Jaguar.&nbsp; The 
        same &quot;old&quot; problems that plagued the computer division seemed to affect 
        any assault on the gaming world.&nbsp; The handheld Lynx was a coup for 
        Atari, but one has to ask why it was delayed for some 2 years, 
        apparently it was ready to go in 1987!&nbsp; Nintendo launched an 
        inferior product technically in the Game Boy, and it soon dominated the 
        gaming world, yet the superior Lynx slowly faded into obscurity helped 
        along by its parent company... Atari.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The 64-Bit Atari Jaguar, the last hope for 
        the company, had a great start.&nbsp; It can not be denied that the 
        system was powerful, and the press and public alike, couldn't wait to 
        get their hands on one.&nbsp; The machine was late to market, and the 
        games were taking time to develop, but during 1994, it still seemed 
        possible that the Jaguar would do it for Atari.&nbsp; There was even 
        talk that the now defunct computer division might be resurrected with a 
        system based on Jaguar technology, the share price was active again, and 
        Atari was back in the lime-light, somewhere it had not been for quite a 
        while.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">By the end of 1995, as projects such as the 
        VR Helmet and the online gaming modem were cancelled, new games  only trickled out of the Atari warehouse and stores began putting 
        bargain price tags on the Jaguar console, it was clear to see something was wrong.&nbsp; 
        Sony was wooing the market with Playstation, and Atari was looking for 
        an exit.&nbsp; It had tried to win back the helicon days that defined 
        the launch and success of the 2600, but sadly it didn't work out.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">So, there you have it.&nbsp; A brief summary 
        of the Tramiel era.&nbsp; For every little thing they may have done 
        wrong, they also did some good things too.&nbsp; I'm still thankful when 
        I boot up my Jaguar to play Tempest 2000, and my friends still can't 
        believe that the Lynx is so good, especially knowing it was launched in 
        1989!&nbsp; My ST still works, and has never caused me any problems, and 
        its nice to turn it on now and again, just for the nostalgia value.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">In closing, I can only assume those that &quot;got on&quot; with 
        Jack Tramiel in particular, liked his personal style, he was straight 
        talking and didn't waste time making decisions.&nbsp; Sam Tramiel was a 
        lot more relaxed, compared to his father, and those who have met and 
        worked with him provide testimony to this.&nbsp; I wouldn't say that any 
        of the Tramiel family were selfish in the running of Atari, they did 
        deliver good products with affordable price tags, and although its easy 
        now to criticise what are historical facts, you must still admire what 
        they successfully achieved and ultimately what they &quot;tried&quot; to achieve.&nbsp; 
        Commodore left the stage long before Atari, as did many other companies 
        that shared the cut-throat world of consumer electronics both as 
        partners and competitors to each other.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">So, what did the Tramiels ever do for Atari?&nbsp; 
        They gave us another 12 years of Atari branded products, and we can all 
        be grateful for that.</font></p>
