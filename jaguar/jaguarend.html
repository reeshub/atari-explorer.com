                      <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Significant Operating 
						Losses</b>. Disappointing Sales of Jaguar Products. 
						Atari has incurred significant operating losses for the 
						past five fiscal years. Most recently, Atari incurred an 
						operating loss of $53.7 million for fiscal 1995 and 
						$24.0 million for fiscal 1994. Over the past several 
						years, Atari has undergone significant change. In 1992 
						and 1993, Atari significantly downsized its operations, 
						decided to exit the computer products business and 
						focused its efforts on its video game business.&nbsp; While 
						restructuring, Atari developed its 64-bit Jaguar 
						interactive multimedia entertainment system, which was 
						introduced in the fourth quarter of 1993. For 1995 and 
						1994, net sales of Jaguar and related software and 
						accessories were $9.9 million and $29.3 million, 
						respectively, and were substantially below Atari's 
						expectations. Atari attributes the poor performance of 
						Jaguar products to a number of factors including:<b> </b>
						</font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>(i)</b> extensive delays in 
						development of software for Jaguar which resulted in 
						reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles 
						for the platform would be released and how many titles 
						would ultimately be available, and&nbsp;<br>
						<b>(ii)</b> the introduction of competing products by 
						Sega Enterprises, Ltd. (&quot;Sega&quot;) and Sony Corporation 
						(&quot;Sony&quot;) in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively. 
						Due to disappointing sales and competitive pricing 
						pressures, Atari reduced the suggested retail price of 
						the Jaguar console from its original price of $249.99 to 
						its current price of $99.99.&nbsp;</font><p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">As a result of Jaguar price 
						reductions, the substantial curtailment of sales and 
						marketing activities for the Jaguar and the substantial 
						curtailment of efforts by Atari and independent software 
						developers to develop additional software titles for the 
						Jaguar, Atari expects sales of Jaguar and related 
						products to decline substantially in 1996 and 
						thereafter.&nbsp;</font><p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">The failure of Jaguar to 
						achieve commercial acceptance has had a severe financial 
						impact on Atari. In this regard, Atari reported a net 
						loss of $49.6 million for 1995 compared to net income of 
						$9.4 million in 1994, and Atari's net revenues declined 
						from $38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 
						1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerated amortization and write-offs of 
						software development costs in the amount of $16.6 
						million and inventory write-downs of $12.6 million 
						contributed&nbsp;significantly to the 1995 loss. The net loss 
						for the first quarter of 1996 was $800,000 compared to a 
						net loss of $4.4 million for the first quarter of 1995 
						and Atari's net revenues declined from $4.9 million for 
						the first quarter of 1995 to $1.3 million for the 
						comparable period in 1996.&nbsp;</font><p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">The net loss in the first 
						quarter of 1996 was impacted by the $6.3 million gain 
						from sale of marketable securities offset by a $5.0 
						million inventory write-down in the quarter. In response 
						to these losses, the number of employees at Atari was 
						reduced from 101 at December 31, 1994 to 73 at December 
						31, 1995 and to 31 at March 31, 1996. In addition to 
						reductions in the Atari workforce, this downsizing 
						resulted in significant curtailment of research and 
						development and sales and marketing activities for 
						Jaguar and related products.&nbsp;Accordingly, Atari has 
						decided to focus its efforts on selling its inventory of 
						Jaguar and related products and to emphasize its 
						existing licensing and development&nbsp;activities related to 
						multimedia entertainment software for various platforms.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Risk of Additional Inventory Write-Downs</b>. From 
						the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through May 
						1996, Atari sold approximately 135,000 units of Jaguar.</font><p align="center" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">
						<img border="0" src="../images/jagquote1.gif" width="217" height="145"></font><p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">As of December 31, 1995, Atari 
						had approximately 100,000 units of Jaguar in inventory 
						and the value of Jaguar inventory and related software 
						was approximately $9.9 million. Due to disappointing 
						sales of Jaguar and increased competition from products 
						introduced by Sega and Sony, Atari reduced the&nbsp;suggested 
						retail price of Jaguar to $99.99 and recorded an 
						inventory write-down of $12.6 million in 1995.&nbsp;
						</font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the introduction of 
						four additional game titles in the first quarter of 
						1996, sales of Jaguar and related software have remained 
						disappointing due to uncertainty about Atari's 
						commitment to the Jaguar platform, increased price 
						competition and pending competitive product 
						introductions. As a result of continued disappointing 
						sales, management revised&nbsp;estimates and wrote-down 
						inventory by an additional $5.0 million in the first 
						quarter of 1996. As of the end of May 1996, Atari had 
						approximately 90,000 units of Jaguar in inventory.&nbsp;
						</font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Volume sales of Jaguar and 
						related software in 1996 have consisted primarily of a 
						large order from a new European customer. Atari is also 
						pursuing wholesale sales channels in the U.S. as well as 
						licensing opportunities. There can be no assurance that 
						Atari's substantial unsold inventory of Jaguar and 
						related software can be sold at current or reduced 
						prices, if at all. In addition, any further decrease in 
						the value of such inventory could result in additional 
						inventory write-downs by Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Risk of Potential 
						Liabilities</b>. In connection with the restructuring of 
						Atari's business in 1992 and 1993 and Atari's decision 
						in late 1995 to significantly downsize its Jaguar 
						operations, Atari has terminated and plans to terminate 
						numerous contracts and business relationships, including 
						several related to software development activities. 
						Although Atari does not regard any of such contracts or 
						business relationships as material, the termination of 
						contracts and relationships has, from time to time, 
						resulted in litigation, diverting management and 
						financial resources. There can be no assurance that the 
						parties to such contracts will not commence or threaten 
						to commence litigation related to such contracts. Any 
						such litigation or threatened litigation would further 
						divert management and financial resources and could have 
						a material adverse effect on Atari's business, operating 
						results and financial condition.&nbsp; </font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, Atari holds 
						several properties for sale, some of which are currently 
						being leased. The ownership and use of such properties 
						subjects Atari&nbsp;to numerous risks, including risks of 
						environmental and personal injury liabilities. Although 
						Atari is attempting to sell certain of such properties, 
						such sales are not expected to eliminate all the risks 
						associated with Atari's ownership of such properties, 
						including potential environmental liabilities and 
						ongoing indemnification and other contractual 
						obligations. At present, Atari has no such 
						indemnification obligations and is not aware of any such 
						environmental liability.&nbsp; </font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Intellectual Property</b>. 
						Atari has exclusive use of its &quot;Atari&quot; name and &quot;Fuji&quot; 
						logo in all areas other than coin-operated arcade video 
						game use. Atari also has a portfolio of other 
						intellectual properties including patents, trademarks, 
						and copyrights associated with its video game and 
						computer businesses. Atari believes its patents, 
						trademarks and other intellectual&nbsp;property are important 
						assets.&nbsp; </font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">As of May 31, 1996, Atari held 
						over 150 patents in the United States and other 
						jurisdictions which expire from 1996 to 2010 and had 
						applications pending for three additional patents. There 
						can be no assurance that any of these patent rights will 
						be upheld in the future or that Atari will be able to 
						preserve any of its other intellectual property rights. 
						Atari has in the past received communications from third 
						parties asserting rights to certain of its intellectual 
						property.&nbsp; </font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Atari has also been involved 
						in several major lawsuits regarding its intellectual 
						property, including a suit with Nintendo of America, 
						Inc. and its affiliates (&quot;Nintendo.&quot;) which was settled 
						in March 1994 and a suit with Sega which was settled in 
						September 1994. In the event any third party were to 
						make a valid claim with respect to Atari's intellectual 
						property and a license were not available on 
						commercially reasonable terms, Atari's&nbsp;business, 
						financial condition and results of operations would be 
						materially and adversely affected. Litigation, which has 
						in the past resulted and could in the future result in 
						substantial costs and diversion of resources, may also 
						be necessary to enforce Atari's patents or other 
						intellectual property rights or to defend against third 
						party infringement claims. The occurrence of litigation 
						relating to patent infringement or other intellectual 
						property matters, regardless of the outcome, could have 
						a material adverse effect on Atari's business, financial 
						condition and results of operations.&nbsp; </font>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Competition</b>. The video 
						game business is intensely competitive. Since its 
						introduction in late 1993, the Jaguar, Atari's principal 
						product, has failed to achieve broad market acceptance. 
						Atari does not expect that the Jaguar, even at its 
						substantially reduced price, will ever become a broadly 
						accepted video game console, or that Jaguar technology 
						will be broadly adopted by software title developers. 
						The video game industry is also characterized by 
						unpredictable and rapid shifts in the popularity of 
						certain platforms, by severe price&nbsp;competition, and by 
						frequent new technology and product introductions.&nbsp;In 
						this regard, numerous companies have introduced or have 
						developed and are expected to introduce video game 
						consoles that are or may become competitive with Jaguar. 
						In addition, an increasing number of entertainment 
						titles are being developed for or ported to the PC 
						platform. Most of Atari's competitors have greater 
						experience and expertise in 3D graphics and multimedia 
						technology and have substantially greater engineering, 
						marketing and financial resources than Atari.</font></td>
