                      have enjoyed that experience.&nbsp; But how many of you 
                      notice the music?&nbsp; It's an element of a computer game 
                      that is either inconsequential to your experience (but 
                      important never-the-less), or it is something you view as 
                      integral to the gameplay and visuals.&nbsp; Just as music 
                      plays an important role in the movies, being in some cases 
                      as critical as the moving images, music in video games can 
                      be as vital an element.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Music means different things 
                      to different people, and music in games may not warrant 
                      the appreciation that say, the music of Beethoven does.&nbsp; 
                      Music created on the consoles of today is very different 
                      to that produced on home computers and consoles of the 
                      80's and early 90's, and I suspect many of you would 
                      probably agree that its much better!&nbsp; Today's 
                      consoles utilise highly advanced CD and DSP combinations 
                      which produce studio quality reproductions, and game music 
                      that is even good enough to receive a commercial release 
                      of its own.</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">In the early days, consoles 
                      could only &quot;beep&quot;.&nbsp; Later, they produced different 
                      levels of &quot;beeps&quot;, and soon, as transistor technology 
                      moved on, companies such as General Instruments, Casio, 
                      Yamaha and others, began producing silicon chips purely 
                      for sound applications.&nbsp; These early chips, or 
                      Programmable Sound Generators (PSG's) soon found their way 
                      into arcade machines, home computers and video consoles.&nbsp; 
                      In the late 70's and early 80s', companies such as Atari 
                      and Commodore actually designed and manufactured their own 
                      sound chips, sometimes with multiple purposes and not 
                      purely for sound.&nbsp; Of these, the most famous are the 
                      Commodore (MOS) 6581SID, and the Atari POKEY (Ports and 
                      Keys, invented at Atari by Steven T. Mayer, Ronald E. 
                      Milner).&nbsp; Sound from these dedicated sound chips was 
                      above average, especially for the time.&nbsp; It took the 
                      PC another 10 years from the early 80's to make any 
                      noticeable sound other than a beep...</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">In the early days of computer 
                      games, the music was an afterthought, if it was even 
                      thought of at all.&nbsp; But soon, computer games began 
                      having &quot;loading&quot; music, or a tune on the main menu.&nbsp; 
                      People began to take notice of these tunes, and as time 
                      went by, games reviewers also paid more attention to these 
                      sound elements, spreading the word that yes, computers 
                      could make music too.&nbsp; With the reviews, came an 
                      innocent stardom for the early game &quot;musicians&quot;.&nbsp; 
                      Names such as Rob Hubbard, Chris Abbott, Martin Galway, 
                      David Whittacker, Wally Beben and Ben Daglish to name but 
                      a few, became famous for their pioneering sound work.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">But was this &quot;real&quot; music?&nbsp; 
                      Personally, I know very few people who enjoy these sounds, 
                      as their opinion of music perhaps differs wildly to mine.&nbsp; 
                      Those of you who enjoyed playing games in the early 80's 
                      and 90's, is it possible you just didn't stop to 
                      appreciate the music?&nbsp; Was the actual game more 
                      important?&nbsp; Or, you just plain hated this so called 
                      music?&nbsp; Its hard to gauge who enjoyed this music, but 
                      certainly many people did, and still do.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                      Perhaps you can break it down to those who knew the skill 
                      required to make such music and thus appreciated the sound 
                      a lot more, and then there ware those who just enjoyed the 
                      music for what it was, a catchy tune.&nbsp; Whatever the 
                      reasons, music (or whatever you may call it) produced on 
                      these pieces of silicon is an important part of computer 
                      gaming history, and to many, it still sounds as good as 
                      any &quot;tune&quot; knocked up by Beethoven... probably.</font></p>

                      Atari ST sound chip for this article, the famous (or 
                      infamous) Yamaha YM-2149 SSG (Software-Controlled Sound 
                      Generator).&nbsp; The chip also drives the Atari ST

                      Peripheral (MFP) 68901).&nbsp; It is a 3-Voice (or 
                      channel) sound processor, capable of 8 Octaves and has 
                      other features such as a 5-bit envelope-generator and

                      listening to the sounds produced on the Atari 8-Bit 
                      computer (POKEY), I was looking forward to even better 
                      sound on the ST range.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as I was 
                      reading all about this new wonder machine from Atari, it 
                      seemed sound wouldn't be its strong point.&nbsp; Those in 
                      the know, were slating the sound chip Atari had placed 
                      inside the ST, a Yamaha YM-2149.&nbsp; Technically, this 
                      chip was used in part to reduce costs, and to aid the 
                      Atari ST Parallel port device, in the end, Atari was 
                      pushing the MIDI capability of the ST rather than the 
                      internal sound abilities.</font></p>

                      to me.&nbsp; Until I saw a graphics demo in a store one 
                      day.&nbsp; It was called &quot;The Little Sound Demo&quot;, and had 
                      a graphic picture of Rob Hubbard, with the words &quot;wow&quot; 
                      coming out of a speech bubble.&nbsp; I knew of Rob Hubbard 
                      from the Commodore 64 games, and was a fan the very first 
                      time I heard the music &quot;Warhawk&quot; on the 8-Bit Atari.&nbsp; 
                      This demo, would be my first introduction to the sound of 
                      the ST, and at the time, I thought it was fantastic, 
                      little did I know that the new Amiga would have a sound 
                      chip (called &quot;Paula&quot;) that would put the ST's YM-2149 to 
                      shame.</font></p>

                      features and the ability to drive high quality sampled 
                      sounds without hogging the main CPU.&nbsp; The Amiga won 
                      hands down in the sound department, but was it really the 
                      end for decent music on the ST?&nbsp; Its common knowledge 
                      that the ST became the market leader for sound 
                      applications through its on-board MIDI ports, but this was

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">For fans of computer generated 
                      music, these were great times.&nbsp; Commercial games were 
                      not the place to hear ground breaking use of the ST sound 
                      chip, no, you had to get the demos!&nbsp; Demos were, for 
                      want of a better description, sound and graphic 
                      demonstrations.&nbsp; A whole host of &quot;groups&quot; became 
                      known for their work, and they competed to push each demo 
                      to a higher technical plain.&nbsp; Initially, ST Demos 
                      started out to prove what could be done on the Amiga could 
                      be done on the ST, and it was argued that the level of 
                      coding being produced on the ST was easily better 
                      technically than anything been produced on the Amiga, 
                      because the Amiga &quot;could already do these things&quot;...</font></p>

                      effects never seen (or heard) before, and many were 
                      probably not even conceived by the original hardware 
                      designers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the internal sound on the 
                      ST was still its weak point.&nbsp; But these clever 
                      &quot;coders&quot;, soon pushed even the original limits of the 
                      YM-2149, and over the years, sound that was once thought 
                      impossible soon began to radiate from the Yamaha silicon.&nbsp; 
                      In the ST world, names like Jochen Hippel, Nic Alderton, 
                      Frank Seemann, Gunnar Gaubatz, were (and some still are) 
                      just a few of the top sound programmers on the YM-2149, 
                      producing amazing musical arrangements for games and 
                      demos.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">The ST sound chip was similar 
                      to the AY-3-8910(12) from General Instruments (it was also 
                      pin-compatible with the YM-2149), and this chip was used 
                      in computers/consoles such as the Sega Master System, the 
                      Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128, Amstrad CPC range, the Mattel 
                      Intellivision and the BBC (Acorn) Microcomputer.&nbsp; 
                      Other computers such as the MSX range, also used 
                      derivatives of these chips.&nbsp; Their popularity was due 
                      to their simplicity of design and integration with the 
                      more popular CPU's of the time, they were also extremely 
                      cost effective and negated the need to design a 
                      proprietary sound processor.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Most of the early sound and 
                      music was programmed in pure assembler, with the more 
                      complicated sounds being created by the programmer who 
                      accessed the sound chip directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, 
                      these sounds were available through dedicated sound 
                      editors that provided graphical interfaces for easier 
                      music composition.&nbsp; But you still needed to 
                      understand the sound processor (and have a basic 
                      understanding of sound theory) to produce anything above 
                      average.&nbsp; The majority of the sound editors were 
                      proprietary programs written by the sound programmers 
                      themselves, and it wasn't until recently that some of 
                      these programs became available through the internet.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">ST sound progressed in the 
                      late 80's to include more than the three flat voices and 
                      noise effects it was basically capable of.&nbsp; Soon, 
                      sampled sound was encoded through the YM-2149 to produce 
                      what became known as &quot;digi-drum&quot; effects, a much more 
                      believable range of drum and snare sounds which added 
                      greatly to the overall music which was being created.&nbsp; 
                      An even grater step was made in the early 90's, when a 
                      form of SID voice was produced, a wave-form voice based on 
                      the sound of the Commodore SID chip.&nbsp; New reply 
                      routines were produced, and ST sound was coming of age, 
                      and although more powerful &quot;sound cards&quot; were being 
                      produced to enable PC's to produce much more advanced 
                      sound, the authenticity and honesty of real &quot;chip&quot; music 
                      couldn't be imitated.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">So, what is the essence of 
                      this electronic sound? These are purely synthetic sounds, 
                      a creation of the chip musicians themselves.&nbsp; The 
                      chip is obviously a man-made device, like all the great 
                      traditional instruments, but based on the advances of 
                      silicon chips instead of wood, strings and ivory.&nbsp; A 
                      great deal of skill and dedication is required to produce 
                      music on these sound chips, and it is generally excepted 
                      that the heady days of computer chip music is over, apart 
                      from the last remaining devotes of the art.&nbsp; In the 
                      last few years, a small renaissance has begun in the sound 
                      chip community, with live shows playing to hundreds of 
                      people reliving the retro-culture of synthetic sound, and 
                      employing the still famous compositions of the early game 
                      musicians.&nbsp; Demo coders of old are still playing host 
                      to new productions on the once great home computers, and a 
                      small &quot;scene&quot; still thrives at local coding &quot;conventions&quot; 
                      all over the world, but particularly in Europe.</font></p>

                      the Playstation as their first foray into video games have 
                      missed an era of experimentation in sound, a time when 
                      everything was new, and when computer music was growing 
                      up.&nbsp; Soundtracks today are composed in studios, or 
                      through sequencers, with the end result recorded straight 
                      onto the CD, real-world sounds that are as closer to 
                      orchestral sessions and with no assembler required.&nbsp; 
                      The internet allows those interested to hold an ear to the 
                      past, and figure out if this sound is something they like 
                      or dislike, but I would hazard a guess and assume they 
                      don't really care, because Mario and Luigi have grown up

                      Its very hard to convey the sound that comes out of the ST 
                      in words alone, so AEX has provided various example files, 
                      plug-ins and players to download for your own enjoyment 
                      (available from the side-bar menu).&nbsp; You can also get 
                      a comparative example of a track produced on the YM-2149, 
                      and it modern day equivalent, so you can compare a normal 
                      sound-chip file with a &quot;digi version&quot;, and a &quot;SID&quot; based 
                      version.&nbsp; You will need WinAmp to play the SC68 files 
                      with the plug-in provided, but the sound quality from this 
                      YM-2149 reply routine is the closest your going to get to 
                      the real thing!&nbsp; ST Sound is another fine YM-2149 
                      player, and we've also included sample files for this.&nbsp; 
                      Just unzip and play.&nbsp; If you haven't listened to 
                      music like this before, I urge you to give it a try (as 
                      Jochen Hippel once said!).&nbsp; No disrespect was meant
