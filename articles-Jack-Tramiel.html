        <font face="Arial" size="2">Only
        10 when the Nazis marched into his city of Lodz, Poland, in 1939, Jack
        Tramiel (then named Idek Tramielski) initially had a kid's thrilled
        reaction to the sheer spectacle of the scene: weapons glinting in the
        sun, soldiers goose-stepping, planes overhead. &quot;It was a fantastic
        thing,&quot; he remembers.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Reality
        crashed down after that. Lodz's Jews--one-third of the city's 600,000
        people--were ordered out of their homes and into a crowded ghetto. For
        nearly five years Jack (an only child) and his parents lived there in
        one room, scavenged for food, and worked--his father at shoemaking, Jack
        in a pants factory. The faces that the Tramiels saw in the ghetto
        changed constantly: Jews left, new Jews came in, often from other
        countries. Later Tramiel learned that the Jewish leader of the ghetto
        was parcelling out its residents to the Germans, believing that the
        community would be left in relative peace as long as he periodically
        delivered up a contingent of its residents for deportation--and no doubt
        extermination.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">In
        August 1944 the Tramiels themselves were herded into railroad cars, told
        they were going to Germany to better themselves, and instead shipped to
        Auschwitz. Jack's most vivid memory of the three-day trip is that each
        person received a whole loaf of bread as a ration--a feast beyond his
        imagination. At journey's end, the men were separated from the women (at
        which point Jack lost track of his mother) and then themselves split
        into two groups, one permitted for the time being to live, the other
        sent to Auschwitz's gas chambers. Jack and his father were thumbed into
        the group that survived.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">A
        few weeks later, Jack and his father were &quot;examined&quot; by the
        notorious Dr. Josef Mengele and thumbed again into a survivors line.
        &quot;What do you mean--examined?&quot; Tramiel is asked. &quot;He
        touched my testicles. He judged whether we were strong enough to
        work.&quot; Having passed, Tramiel and his father were transported to a
        spot just outside Hanover, Germany, and there set to building a
        concentration camp into whose barracks they themselves moved. In weather
        that was often bitter cold, they worked in thin, pyjama-like garments,
        and they grew increasingly emaciated on a deprivation diet: watery
        &quot;soup&quot; and bread in the morning, and a potato, bread, and more
        &quot;soup&quot; at night.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">By
        December 1944 the Tramiels were assigned to different work crews and
        seeing each other only occasionally. At one of their meetings the father
        told the son that many young people in the camp were managing to smuggle
        food to their elders--and why hadn't Jack done that for his father?
        Stung, Jack studied for days how to deal with an electric fence that
        stood between him and an SS kitchen and finally succeeded in burrowing
        his thin frame under it to steal food--one potato and some peels. But
        when he got the food to his father, malnutrition had gripped the older
        man and grossly swollen his body. He could not eat. Soon after, he died
        in the camp's infirmary. Later, Jack learned that the death was directly
        caused by an injection of gasoline into his father's veins.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">As
        the winter stretched into the spring of 1945, Jack Tramiel himself grew
        increasingly fatalistic. But then a strange end-of-the-war tableau
        unfolded. First, the Germans vanished from the camp; second, the Red
        Cross moved in briefly, overfed the prisoners to the point that some
        died, and then left; third, the Germans returned and then vanished
        again. On their heels came two American soldiers--&quot;20-foot-tall
        black men, the first blacks I'd ever seen,&quot; says Tramiel--who
        loomed in a barracks door, peered at the prisoners hiding beneath the
        straw of their bunks, said something in English that one Jew gleaned as
        &quot;More Americans will be coming,&quot; and left. Next a tank rolled
        up. In it stood a Jewish chaplain in dress uniform, who declared in
        Yiddish: &quot;You are free,&quot; and told the tank to move on. These
        were troops of the advancing American Army, the month was April 1945,
        and Tramiel was 16.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Tramiel,
        today 69 and a fireplug in build, stayed in Europe for more than two
        years after his liberation, and many of his recollections of those days
        concern food: how he tricked his way into a sanatorium to a rich, and
        shamefully fattening, diet; how he gorged happily while working in an
        American Army kitchen; how he did other odd jobs for &quot;money or
        food.&quot; But he also learned during this time that his mother was
        alive and back again in Lodz. He saw her there but then left, resolved
        by that time to marry a concentration-camp survivor he'd met, Helen
        Goldgrub, and go with her to the U.S.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The
        two wed in Germany in July 1947. They got to the U.S. separately,
        though--he first, in November of that year. His confidence, strengthened
        by what he'd survived, bordered on hubris: &quot;I figured I could
        handle just about anything,&quot; he says. He started out living at a
        Jewish agency, HIAS, in New York City; got a job as a handyman at a
        Fifth Avenue lamp store; learned English from American movies; and at
        their end pigged out on chocolate instead of eating regular dinners.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Then,
        in early 1948, he did the improbable, joining the U.S. Army. By the time
        he left it four years later, he'd been reunited with his wife and
        fathered a son (the first of three). The Army had also pointed him to a
        career by putting him in charge of repairing office equipment in the New
        York City area.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">When
        Tramiel checked back into civilian life, he entered a long period of
        close encounters with machines that typed words and manipulated numbers.
        He first worked, at $50 a week, for a struggling typewriter-repair shop.
        Using his Army connections, Tramiel got the owner a contract to service
        several thousand machines. &quot;The guy flipped,&quot; says Tramiel,
        but did not give his enterprising employee a raise. &quot;I have no
        intention of working for people who have no brains,&quot; said Tramiel
        to the owner, and quit.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Tramiel
        then bought a typewriter shop in the Bronx. He did repair work for
        Fordham University and, when he once got a chance to buy scads of used
        typewriters, rebuilt and resold them. He next prepared to import
        machines from Italy but found he could get the import exclusivity he
        wanted only by moving to Canada. It was in Toronto, in 1955, that he
        founded a company he called Commodore, an importer and eventually a
        manufacturer of both typewriters and adding machines. Why Commodore?
        Because Tramiel wanted a name with a military ring and because higher
        ranks, such as General and Admiral, were already taken.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Commodore
        went public in 1962 at a Canadian bargain-basement price of $2.50 a
        share--a deal that raised funds Tramiel needed to pay off big loans he'd
        gotten from a Canadian financier named C. Powell Morgan, head of
        Atlantic Acceptance. Deep trouble erupted in the mid-1960s when
        Atlantic, to which Commodore was almost joined at the hip, went
        bankrupt, amid charges of fraudulent financial statements, dummy
        companies, and propped stock prices. Tramiel was never charged with
        illegalities, but an investigative commission concluded that he was
        probably not blameless. In any case, the Canadian financial
        establishment ostracized him. Struggling to keep Commodore itself out of
        bankruptcy, he was forced in 1966 to give partial control of the company
        to Canadian investor Irving Gould.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Commodore's
        line then was still typewriters and adding machines, but the electronics
        revolution was under way and setting up shop in Silicon Valley. Tramiel
        himself moved there in the late 1960s and soon, displaying a
        speed-to-market talent that has characterized his whole life, had
        Commodore pumping out electronic calculators. In time, one product, a
        hand-held calculator, grew so popular that it was self-destructive: The
        company that supplied Commodore with semiconductor chips, Texas
        instruments, decided to produce calculators itself--selling them at
        prices that Commodore couldn't match.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">With
        Commodore again reeling, Tramiel vowed never again to be at the mercy of
        a vital supplier. In 1976 he made a momentous acquisition: MOS
        Technology, a Pennsylvania chip manufacturer that also turned out to be
        extravagantly nurturing about 200 different R&amp;D projects. Tramiel, a
        slash-and-burn, early-day Al Dunlap in management style, killed most of
        the projects immediately. But he listened hard when an engineer named
        Chuck Peddle told him the company had a chip that was effectively a
        microcomputer. And small computers, said Peddle, &quot;are going to be
        the future of the world.&quot;</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Willing
        to take a limited gamble, Tramiel told Peddle that he and Tramiel's
        second son, Leonard, then getting a Columbia University astrophysics
        degree, had six months to come up with a computer Commodore could
        display at an upcoming Comdex electronics show. They made the deadline.
        &quot;And everyone loved the product,&quot; says Tramiel, relishingly
        rolling out its name, PET, for Personal Electronic Transactor.
        Unfortunately, this was potentially an expensive pet, carrying a lot of
        risk--and demanding, says Tramiel, &quot;a lot of money I still did not
        have.&quot; So he determined to gauge demand by running newspaper ads
        that offered six-week delivery on a computer priced at $599, a seductive
        figure on which Tramiel thought he could still make a profit. The ads
        appeared, and a hugely encouraging $3 million in checks came back.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Commodore
        got to the market with its computer in 1977, the same year that Apple
        and Tandy put their micros on sale. In the next few years, Tramiel drove
        those competitors and others wild by combatively pushing prices down and
        down, to levels like $200. He also became famous for rough treatment of
        suppliers, customers, and executives--and about it all was fiercely
        unrepentant. &quot;Business is war,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't believe
        in compromising. I believe in winning.&quot;</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Which
        is what he did in those early years for computers, leading Commodore to
        $700 million in sales in fiscal 1983 and $88 million in profits. At its
        peak price in those days, the stock that Tramiel had sold in 1962 at a
        price of $2.50 a share was up to $1,200, and his 6.5% slice of the
        company was worth $120 million.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">But
        then, in early 1984, just as annual sales were climbing above $1
        billion, Tramiel clashed with a Commodore stockholder mightier than he,
        Irving Gould--and when the smoke had cleared, Tramiel was out. The
        nature of their quarrel was never publicly disclosed. Today, however,
        Tramiel says he wanted to &quot;grow&quot; the company, and Gould
        didn't.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Commodore
        was really Tramiel's last hurrah. True, he surfaced again quickly in the
        computer industry, agreeing later in 1984 to take over--for a
        pittance--Warner Communications' floundering Atari operation. But in a
        business changing convulsively as IBM brought out its PC and the clones
        marched in, Atari was a loser and ultimately a venture into which
        Tramiel was unwilling to sink big money. Eventually he folded Atari into
        a Silicon Valley disk-drive manufacturer, JTS, in which he has a major
        interest but plays no operational role.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Today
        Tramiel is basically retired and managing his money. From four
        residences, he's cut down to one, a palatial house atop a foothill in
        Monte Sereno, California. In its garage are two Rolls-Royces, a type of
        luxury to which Tramiel has long been addicted.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2">Naturally,
        charity fundraisers look Tramiel up. When those for the Holocaust
        Memorial Museum appeared, he at first thought of it as just one more
        philanthropic cause to be supported. But his wife, Helen, 69, who spent
        her concentration camp days at Bergen-Belsen, is intensely aware that
        both she and her husband survived what millions of other Jews did not.
        &quot;No,&quot; she said adamantly, &quot;for this one we have to go all
        out.&quot;</font></p>
