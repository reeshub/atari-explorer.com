                      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><b>Mr. Ferris:</b> 
                      It gives me no pleasure to raise the matter of a further 
                      factory closure in Tipperary town. Last Friday morning, 
                      Namco Ireland Limited announced the closure of its 
                      manufacturing plant with the loss of 42 jobs. Perhaps the 
                      loss of 42 jobs is not very important to the Government, 
                      taking into account some of the job announcements recently 
                      made by the Tánaiste. However, in comparative terms, the 
                      loss of 42 jobs in Tipperary town is the final nail in the 
                      coffin of a town which has staggered from one closure to 
                      another.</font></p>
                      <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10; padding-left: 1px" align="justify">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">As the company 
                      has stated, its share of the traditional games market has 
                      declined in the past few years as the technology gap 
                      between commercial and consumer games closed dramatically. 
                      This has arisen from the huge penetration of personal 
                      computers and highly sophisticated games software. Apart 
                      from job losses in other parts of the county, the litany 
                      of losses sustained in Tipperary town include the 7-Up 
                      soft drinks company, O'Doherty and O'Dwyer, Irish Pride 
                      bakery, Mass Mutual and Tambrands Ireland Limited. Mass 
                      Mutual has been replaced by Continental Promotions and 
                      Tambrands by Pall Corporation. However, these replacement 
                      companies, welcome as they are, are still in the process 
                      of getting into full employment mode, leaving a large 
                      number of unemployed people in Tipperary town. It is a 
                      shame that during this economic boom and the Celtic tiger, 
                      good workers who have excellent relations with their 
                      employers are forced to travel to Clonmel or Limerick 
                      which necessitates a 50 mile round trip. </font></p>

                      Friday morning I met with the directors of Namco, 
                      including Michael Nevin and John McKenzie, the managing 
                      director and financial controller of Namco Europe 
                      respectively, and Patrick Pickham, the general manager of 
                      the Tipperary plant. I am pleased they have agreed to 
                      allow their facility to be marketed by the IDA. I do not 
                      have to tell the Minister, as the Tánaiste has already 
                      issued a statement, that this is one of the most excellent 
                      facilities available to the IDA and the Government. It is 
                      a magnificent facility and I thank the outgoing company 
                      for maintaining it. It has installed a security system to 
                      ensure the factory is not vandalised. It has ensured the 
                      continuation of heating, lighting and cleaning so that 
                      when the Minister, through the IDA, brings in a 
                      prospective customer they will see an excellent facility. 
                      Any prospective company can start up there immediately.</font></font></p>

                      the Government to give a commitment that Tipperary town 
                      will be given the priority it deserves from IDA promotions 
                      in Europe and North America. Nothing less will satisfy the 
                      people of Tipperary town and those of us who represent 
                      them. The company agreed, in consultation with me, to 
                      enter into meaningful and, hopefully, satisfactory 
                      negotiations with union representatives. I hope they will 
                      agree to a fair redundancy package to compensate for the 
                      loss of jobs. Many employees have worked for this company 
                      for more than 20 years. The closure has created and will 
                      create problems for Tipperary town. Every stop needs to be 
                      pulled out so Tipperary town will not be neglected and 
                      left on the industrial heap by the Government or the IDA. 
                      This closure is not the fault of workers or the company.</font></font></p>

                      Tipperary plant which is engaged in the manufacture of 
                      amusement centre video games, with the loss of 50 jobs. 
                      This decision has resulted from the loss of its contract 
                      to supply its main customer, WMS, with Atari product. This 
                      product represented 60 per cent of turnover in the

                      1978 and one in Limerick in 1982. At that time they were 
                      world leaders in video games and home computers. Over the 
                      years, the company lost market share to the more 
                      sophisticated Sony and Sega products. This resulted in the 
                      downsizing of the Tipperary plant and the closure of the 
                      Limerick plant.</font></font></p>

                      Chicago, which is in the same business. Namco corporation, 
                      a $500 million dollar business with global leisure 
                      interests, purchased the manufacturing facility in 
                      Tipperary from WMS and a contract was agreed to continue 
                      to supply the Atari product to Europe on its behalf. In 
                      addition, Namco manufactured some of its own product for 
                      Europe in the Tipperary facility.</font></font></p>

                      Following the loss of the WMS contract, the only remaining 
                      production in the County Tipperary facility was Namco's 
                      own product, the volume of which would not be sufficient 
                      to maintain the operation. IDA Ireland requested that 
                      Namco consider the option of making Ireland its principal 
                      European manufacturing base. However, despite IDA 
                      Ireland's best efforts, in discussion with the company and 
                      at meetings with the Japanese owners regarding the various 
                      options, Namco has decided that the only option is to 
                      close the facility. Namco previously closed its UK
