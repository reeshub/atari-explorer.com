                      started it all with Pong, is still going strong.&nbsp; His

                      cheaper.&nbsp; But when it comes to arcade games, it's everyone 
                      else who follows in their footsteps. These days you can't 
                      go into an arcade without overdosing on games from the 
                      land of the rising coin slot, with giants like Sega, 
                      Taito, CapCom, SNK, and Konami all household names to the 
                      arcade aficionado.</font></p>

                      in their attempts to stop them in their tracks, there is 
                      one American company that not only manages to hold its own 
                      against the great oriental steamroller, but also carries 
                      on as one of the arcade industry's great innovators</font></span><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">While the name Atari might 
                      suggest a company of Japanese origins, it prefers hot dogs 
                      and Mom's apple pie to sushi and Mama&#8209;Sans' lychees any 
                      day of the week.&nbsp; Founded by electronics wizard and 
                      visionary Nolan Bushnell in the early 70s, Atari takes its 
                      name from the classic Japanese board game Go.&nbsp; Anyone 
                      who's played the game will know that an Atari is the Go 
                      equivalent of check in Chess. The well&#8209;known logo is a 
                      representation on Japan's famous volcano Mount Fuji &#8209; 
                      Bushnell chose it because he was a great fan of the 
                      Japanese genericism, and wanted to give his firm an 
                      oriental flavour.</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Atari erupted in 1972 with the 
                      bat 'n' ball classic Pong.&nbsp; What is generally accepted as 
                      the world's first video game was designed by Bushnell 
                      himself, and was a runaway success &#8209; for the simple reason 
                      that nobody had ever seen anything quite like it before.&nbsp; 
                      Since then, Atari's enjoyed massive success with games 
                      like Breakout (1976), Asteroids (1979), Missile Command 
                      (1980), Centipede (1981), Pole Position (1982), Star Wars 
                      (1983), Marble Madness (1984), Paperboy and Gauntlet (both 
                      1985), Super Sprint (1986), and Hard Drivin' (1989) &#8209; all 
                      of which served to ensure that Bushnell's baby was no 
                      one&#8209;game wonder.&nbsp; But even so, the company served up its 
                      fair share of obscurities in its time &#8209; ever heard of 
                      Cloak &amp; Dagger, Arabian, Canyon Bomber or Smokey Joe? No?&nbsp; 
                      We thought not.&nbsp; (AEX  Most of the obscure games 
                      mentioned were not widely available in Europe).</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Before long, Atari moved out 
                      of the arcades and into the homes with the launch of the 
                      VCS 2600 console and, later, its first home computers in 
                      the form of the 400 and 800 range.&nbsp; Since then Atari's 
                      been responsible for the forgettable XL/XE machines and of 
                      course the more memorable ST range.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, these days 
                      Atari isn't the one big happy family you might think &#8209; in 
                      fact it's practically divorced from itself.&nbsp; Bushnell sold 
                      Atari to movie giant Warner Communications in the late 
                      70s, and it wasn't until the early 80's that ex&#8209;Commodore 
                      boss Jack Tramiel arrived on the scene to buy it back but 
                      only half of it.&nbsp; The story goes that Tramiel was only 
                      interested in the home computing side of Atari, as he was 
                      hoping to buy the Amiga from its developers and release it 
                      as an Atari machine.&nbsp; For this reason, he only bought the 
                      computing arm of the company (known as Atari Corporation), 
                      leaving Atari Games as a separate company. </font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Today, Atari Games and Atari 
                      Corporation rarely interact &#8209;they are even based in 
                      completely different offices, and in a sense they are 
                      actually in competition.&nbsp; When Atari Games decided to move 
                      into the expanding home market by producing software, 
                      Atari Corporation stepped in to tell its 'sister' that it 
                      wasn't allowed to use the name Atari in the home computer 
                      market. For this reason, Atari Games came up with its own 
                      publishing label - Tengen, which again comes from the 
                      board game Go.&nbsp; The Tengen is the name given to the centre 
                      of the board. And as Domark's General Manager John 
                      Kavanagh explains, that's why you won't find the Atari 
                      Games name or logo on any of Domark's long line of Atari 
                      coin&#8209;op conversions &#8209; Tramiel bought the rights to use the 
                      Atari name on consumer products as part of the terms of 
                      the sale - Atari Games, therefore, has to market its 
                      software under a different name.&nbsp; (AEX  Domark were a UK 
                      software publisher and marketed practically all the Atari 
                      Game home computer conversions under the Tengen name).</font></p>

                      animations of talking faces, which were seen by the guy

                      making characters run around on screen to show off the 
                      capabilities of the Astrocade machines.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I also co&#8209;wrote a game in 
                      1982 called Professor Pac Man, which was basically a 
                      multiple choice questions and answers game with animated 
                      sequences. The Astrocade was very similar to the hardware 
                      inside the Bally coin&#8209;ops of the time.&nbsp; Professor Pac Man 
                      sold about a thousand copies, and after that, in 1984, I 
                      started a company called Macromind, writing productivity 
                      tools, basically music and art utilities, for a while, and 
                      then I sold out my share in the company, and then wrote 
                      the platform game Dark Castle for the Macintosh.</font></p>

                      about in 1986 when Mark moved to California: &quot;I knew that 
                      there are more computers per square mile there than 
                      anywhere else in the country.&quot; California is the home&#8209;base 
                      of just about every major developer and publishing company 
                      in the States, including Cinemaware, Lucasfilm, Epyx, 
                      Spectrum HoloByte, Electronic Arts, Activision, hardware 
                      manufacturer Apple &#8209; and of course Atari.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Atari has earned itself a 
                      reputation for originality since its inception, with 
                      innovative wares such as Lunar Lander, I Robot, Marble 
                      Madness, Gauntlet, and Cyberball all breaking new ground 
                      and inspiring many &#8209; including Mark: &quot;I joined Atari 
                      because I wanted to produce something different something 
                      more challenging.&nbsp; There are so many shooting and fighting 
                      games in the arcades, and that just wasn't the thing I 
                      wanted to get into.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Mark's first project for Atari 
                      was the ageing race&#8209;and&#8209;destroy classic RoadBlasters, for 
                      which he produced the graphics and co&#8209;designed with 
                      programmers Bonnie Smithson and Richard Moore over the 
                      course of a year.&nbsp; &quot;I still play RoadBlasters,&quot; Mark 
                      confesses. &quot;I think it's a great game because it's so 
                      simple. I really like the combination of driving and 
                      shooting.&nbsp; Ever since we did RoadBlasters I've been really 
                      into race games, but only in the arcades. I think racing 
                      games at home lose the feel because of the lack of a 
                      steering wheel.&quot;</font></p>

                      about with RoadBlasters programmer Bonnie Smithson 
                      producing his biggest and most time&#8209;consuming project to 
                      date &#8209; Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters 
                      (which, for the record, boasts the longest game title in 
                      coin&#8209;op history). From conception to completion, Mark and 
                      his team spent over two years on Escape.&nbsp; But the 
                      inspiration for such an escapist concept has been around 
                      for even longer &#8209; since Mark's childhood in fact.</font></p>

                      a living, and has done since I was a boy, so I grew up 
                      with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always been fascinated by them, and in 
                      particular the concept of an interactive comic book 
                      something where you could actually influence the story 
                      rather than just following along with it.&nbsp; That's what I 
                      was trying to do with Escape &#8209; it's not perfect, but I 
                      think it's getting close to the idea. </font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">As for the scenario, I was 
                      influenced mainly by the 60's Science Fiction B&#8209;movies 
                      like Plan 9 From Outer Space, The Day The Earth Stood 
                      Still and all those other really terrible movies.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">While Escape doesn't offer 
                      anything radically different in the gameplay stakes &#8209; it's 
                      just a matter of shooting the robots and rescuing the 
                      prisoners Mark believes the presentation sets it apart: 
                      &quot;The isometric viewpoint is perfect &#8209; it works so well 
                      because by looking down into a room from the corner you 
                      can see just about everything there is to see.&nbsp; It worked 
                      in Zaxxon, 720° and Populous and I think it works here 
                      too. It was easier for us to do as well &#8209; we just took the 
                      old Isometric Playfield Generator that was written for and 
                      used in Marble Madness and put it to work here &#8209; the basic 
                      routines that run Escape and Marble Madness are one and 
                      the same.&quot;</font></p>

                      over two years (which Mark puts down to the sheer size of 
                      the game), he's now a little tired of the project and was 
                      glad to see it completed. </font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Even so, he still feels 
                      there's room for improvement: &quot;Looking back on Escape, I'm 
                      pleased with it.&nbsp; But if I was starting again on it now, 
                      I'd like to do things a bit differently.&nbsp; For a start I'd 
                      want more flare and more action to make the whole thing 
                      more hectic. At the moment it's not as pacey as I'd have 
                      liked.&nbsp; And I would have liked to have given the player 
                      more control over Jake and Duke by giving them more 
                      combat&#8209;like moves, rather than just shooting away.&nbsp; I like 
                      the games where you've got a whole array of fighting 
                      moves, and that would have worked and added atmosphere to 
                      Escape.&quot; The chance of a second attempt seems unlikely: 
                      &quot;It took over two years to put together &#8209; there's no way I 
                      want to go through all that again just to produce one 
                      game. All I wanted to do next was produce something 
                      playable, compact and relatively quick to develop.&quot;</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">So he did. The result was the 
                      comparatively serene Klax, aimed at the same market as the 
                      classic mental agility test Tetris.</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Our Marketing people saw that 
                      Tetris had created a niche in the market, and I could see 
                      the same thing by watching people play it in the arcades.&nbsp; 
                      What I noticed most was that it was attracting older 
                      players &#8209; probably because it's more of a thinking game.&nbsp; 
                      And I could see that people were getting satisfaction out 
                      of playing it. Tetris has a strange appeal &#8209; it's simple, 
                      and the gameplay is well balanced between the tension of 
                      building something up and the relief of removing lines.&quot;</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">With the seed implanted, Mark 
                      set about producing ideas for gameplay &#8209; by which time 
                      clones wore already appearing.&nbsp; They were mostly just the 
                      same game presented differently and any twists in the 
                      gameplay failed to generate the same kind of tension as 
                      the original &#8209; let alone improve on it: &quot;With Klax I 
                      wanted to produce something along the same lines, and so 
                      create a similar sort of appeal, while giving it a 
                      gameplay style all of its own.&nbsp; No easy task.</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I knew that to create a game 
                      similar in style to Tetris, the rules had to be simple, 
                      but I wanted to do something with, a little extra to ft as 
                      well.&quot;&nbsp; That little extra manifests itself in the shape of 
                      gravity.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">With Tetris, blocks fall when 
                      fines disappear, but only by a single line &#8209; there's no 
                      real gravity, and so it's impossible to set up 'chain 
                      reactions'.&nbsp; With Klax however, Mark did Newton proud by 
                      incorporating a true sense of gravity.&nbsp; The tiles are 
                      supposed to be stacked as they would for real, so when you 
                      take some away, the tiles above fall down until they land 
                      on another, this allows the player to create a Klax that 
                      in turn creates another by the very act of the relevant 
                      blocks disappearing and causing others to fall.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">The idea of making lines of 
                      three or more came from Tic&#8209;Tac&#8209;Toe, which is why Atari is 
                      calling Klax the 'Tic&#8209;Tac&#8209;Tile' game.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's got 
                      enough original elements of its own to not be called just 
                      another Tetris clone.&nbsp; One thing I really like about Klax 
                      is that it's a video game only &#8209; there's no way it could 
                      be done in any other format.&quot;&nbsp; (AEX  We think the Atari 
                      Lynx conversion is probably the best, but we could be a 
                      little biased in that opinion!).</font></p>

                      great surprise to learn that even though Mark is pleased 
                      with the way Klax has turned out, he still feels that 
                      there's room for improvement. &quot;When we came to giving Klax 
                      a name, I wanted to call it something that reflected its 
                      simplicity &#8209; something short, and in complete contrast to 
                      Escape.&nbsp; So I sat down with Dave Akers and said: 'Okay, 
                      we've got five minutes to come up with a title.'&nbsp; Dave 
                      just came out with Klax, and we liked it because it was 
                      short and it also sounded like the klack&#8209;klack sound of 
                      the tiles as they roll down the screen.&nbsp; Looking back, I

                      Marketing people, who inform us of what's popular and 
                      what's likely to make money in the arcades, which is what

                      is that the project is sketched out in rough &#8209; game type, 
                      objectives and so on, and a schedule is made up for the 
                      team to work to, as it's vital they have the game finished 
                      by a certain time.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">This might sound like the 
                      Project Leader has an easy time of it, but Mark is quick 
                      to prove otherwise: &quot;A Project Leader oversees all the 
                      work on the game, but he often also contributes to it in 
                      his own way.&nbsp; I was Project Leader on Escape and Klax, but 
                      I also designed both games and did the graphics. And 
                      believe me, you have to take care of everything from 
                      making sure the work goes according to schedule to 
                      checking that the heating duct above the programmers is 
                      running at the correct temperature!&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Now that the idea has become a 
                      real game design, the team can start work actually writing 
                      it.&nbsp; Even during the technical stages there's not a great 
                      deal to differentiate between coin&#8209;op and home computer 
                      game development...</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;All Atari coin&#8209;ops today are 
                      written in C &#8209; that's the most popular language with the 
                      programmers here, I guess. The actual programming work is 
                      carried out on standard terminals, and then transferred 
                      into our VAX machines where it's compiled and compressed.&nbsp; 
                      Finally it's downloaded from there through an EPROM burner 
                      and onto the hardware for the game that the engineer has 
                      put together. Every coin&#8209;op's hardware is different partly 
                      because each game is different, and partly as a form of 
                      copy protection.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Mark's graphics are produced 
                      on a PC &#8209; but using Atari's own specially written utility: 
                      RAD (Rendering and Animation Design). &quot;It's basically a 
                      standard paint tool with some animation facilities. I 
                      design and draw on the PC before uploading everything to 
                      the VAX to be compressed.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">An Atari game takes, on 
                      average, around a year to produce &#8209; but then an average 
                      can come from two extremes, which is certainly in Mark's 
                      case - Escape took over two years to put together, whereas 
                      Klax was written in just four months!</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Mark feels that game design is 
                      the most difficult and time&#8209;consuming, and yet most 
                      rewarding task: &quot;With an arcade game you have to be very 
                      careful with the design. What you're trying to do is 
                      create something that people will want to play and keep 
                      playing.&nbsp; If you go to see a movie, you pay your six 
                      dollars and go in &#8209; if you decide halfway through that you 
                      don't like it, there's not a lot you can do about it as 
                      you've already paid to see it.&nbsp; If you buy a piece of 
                      software, you pay your 30 dollars then take it home, and 
                      again, if you don't like it, it's too late you've already 
                      paid.&nbsp; But with an arcade game you only have to put in a 
                      quarter, and if you decide in your first game 'Urgh, this 
                      sucks', you can leave it and you've only spent 25 cents.&quot;</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">So if an arcade game is to 
                      recoup its investment it's got to hook people from the 
                      very beginning and hold on tight. &quot;You have to keep the 
                      task simple, so that the potential player will look at it 
                      and say &quot;I can do that', while graphically it has to look 
                      sexy and inviting. That's really all you need to get 
                      somebody playing, but keeping them playing is the hard 
                      part.&nbsp; It's vital that you get the level of difficulty 
                      right &#8209; if a game's too tough, the player will give up, 
                      and if it's too easy you could have one person playing all 
                      day on just one quarter.&nbsp; The ideal level of difficulty is 
                      one that makes a quarter last about a minute and a half.&quot;</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">But unlike appearances, the 
                      level of difficulty is a much more demanding deception, as 
                      arcade players vary greatly in their levels of skill and 
                      patience. So before a game is released it's played 
                      extensively by the teams at Atari and then put on 'field 
                      test', where a few prototype machines are placed in 
                      arcades around the country and the reaction to them is 
                      graded.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You can normally tell at the 
                      very start if a coin&#8209;op's going to sell &#8209; we always keep 
                      one test machine running in the lab, and if it's rarely 
                      played by the people here, it's probably not going to do 
                      well in the arcades either.&nbsp; Fortunately Klax, which has 
                      just been released, has always got a queue of people 
                      waiting to play it here, so we have a pretty good feeling 
                      about it!&quot;</font></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Only when a machine goes on 
                      field test can the public's response be gauged, so 
                      naturally Atari makes the best use it can of the time that 
                      the machine's 'out on trial'.&nbsp; The prototype machines used 
                      are equipped with special video recorders that videotape 
                      the games played on it.&nbsp; When the machines are recalled 
                      the tape is played back so that the team can see if 
                      players are exploiting any potentially disastrous bugs or 
                      unexpected design flaws and iron them out before the 
                      machines go on release. In addition, a computer printout 
                      provides pages of statistics that are dissected to find 
                      out just how good people are at playing the game.</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">But at the end of the day, all 
                      that counts is the amount of money a machine takes &#8209; or 
                      'coindrops' as Mark refers to them. &quot;A machine has to make 
                      money within its first six weeks or it's not going to be 
                      successful.&nbsp; If an arcade owner orders a few machines, and 
                      they don't start making money quickly, he won't order any 
                      more &#8209; and he could well tell his arcade owner friends who 
                      won't order any at all.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">So just how 'big' does a 
                      coin&#8209;op have to be to be classified as a success?&nbsp; &quot;These 
                      days, anything that sells over 10,000 units is fantastic,&quot; 
                      Mark reveals. &quot;Although back in the early days of the 
                      industry, machines could be expected to do a lot more than 
                      that. Tempest, for example, took over 30,000 orders in its 
                      first DAY on release! Williams' Defender has sold over 
                      50,000, and Ms Pac Man 123,000!</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">So why the slump?&nbsp; &quot;I think 
                      because when this business first started, we were dealing 
                      with a brand new technology, so there was a lot of 
                      excitement and a certain amount of novelty value.&nbsp; And 
                      also at the time, the people who played arcade games were 
                      a lot older &#8209; around 18 to 25, and so they had more money 
                      to spend than the average 14 year&#8209;old arcade player of 
                      today. Now the big novelty is gone, but I think at least 
                      the business is much more sane now.&nbsp; And there's still the 
                      occasional massive hit, Gauntlet is probably one of the 
                      biggest sellers that Atari has ever had.&quot;</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial" size="2">Mark admits to being a great 
                      fan of the classic coin&#8209;ops of yesteryear. Defender, 
                      Tempest and Galaga rank amongst his favourites, but what 
                      does he think of the machines commonly found in today's 
                      arcades?&nbsp; &quot;Most of the games over here are either 
                      horizontally&#8209;scrolling blasters or sideways scrolling 
                      combat games, which I think is a shame.&nbsp; I think that 
                      while they're not at all original, they'll always be a 
                      market for them, so the companies will just keep on making 
                      them.&nbsp; It's like rock 'n' roll, most of the popular music 
                      in the charts today isn't too good, but they'll keep 
                      cranking it out because that's what is in demand.&quot;</font></p>

                      killer or anything like that, but even so I don't think 
                      it's a good idea to make people feel comfortable about the

                      &quot;I'm not sure, but I do have a few ideas about the kind of 
                      thing I'd like to see.&nbsp; I'd like to expand what's playable 
                      in the arcades by moving away from shoot 'em ups and the 
                      like and do something else.&nbsp; One idea that might work 
                      would be an RPG coin&#8209;op &#8209; each player would buy a card 
                      that would be inserted into the machine to start the game. 
                      That card would have the player's character stored on it &#8209; 
                      all the information about strengths, skills, objects 
                      carried &#8209; and the machine would read from and write to the 
                      card accordingly.&nbsp; With that system you could carry your 
                      character around in your back pocket and carry on your 
                      game whenever you see a machine.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>

                      anything like that for a while yet, and for the moment, 
                      Mark prefers to look more to the immediate future. &quot;Klax 
                      has just started to ship, and from what we've heard so 
                      far, it's already doing well. One machine in Manhattan is 
                      taking 400 dollars a week! I don't want to jinx anything 
                      by saying that Klax is going to be as big as Tetris, but I 
                      certainly hope that it will.&quot;</font></p>
