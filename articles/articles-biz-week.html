        survive success</b></font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Warner
        Communications is the buyer -- and provider of backing for expansions</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">When
        a small company invades a big market, success can be almost as hard to
        cope with financially as failure. &quot;It takes a lot of cash to build
        a $20 million inventory for a three-month [Christmas] selling
        season,&quot; reflects Nolan K. Bushnell, a 33-year-old computer shit
        who turned an idea for a video ping-pong game into a company that almost
        outgrew itself. Bushnell's company, Atari Inc., of Sunnyvale, California,
        survived success by becoming as clever at playing financial games as at
        designing electronics ones. And last month, chairman Bushnell made his
        shrewdest move yet: He sold Atari -- which earned $3.5 million net on
        sales of $39 million in the fiscal year ended last May – to Warner
        Communications Inc., the cash-rich conglomerate. He thereby netted some
        $15 million for himself and provided the financial backing for Atari to
        grow even faster.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Atari’s
        problem is a cash problem,&quot; says Emanuel Gerard, an executive
        vice-president of Warner, which paid $28 million in cash and debt
        securities for Atari, and money is not a problem for us.&quot; Even with
        its cash nest egg of $250 million, though, Warner may be hard pressed to
        finance all the growth Bushnell is aiming for. By pioneering the
        coin-operated video game market and then developing a game attachment
        for home TV sets, Atari grew tenfold in the last three years. But the
        home video game is still in its infancy. By some industry estimates,
        Atari could be in theory selling some 15 million units a year, with a
        value of nearly $500 million, in three years' time. Caught short. On its
        own, Atari could not hope to take full advantage of this opportunity,
        and until Warner came along it faced the prospect of watching a replay
        of its experience with &quot;Pong,&quot; the first successful
        coin-operated video game. Unable to meet the demand stimulated by Pong's
        success, Atari watched licensees and competitors walk off with most of
        the spoils. &quot;We sold fewer games of the Pong type than anybody
        else,&quot; Bushnell says, &quot;because we didn't have the cash to
        produce what the market demanded.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Indeed,
        it was only through some ingenious financial bootstrapping that Atari
        was able to share in the market at all. Just three years out of the
        University of Utah, Bushnell founded Atari's forerunner, Syzygy Co., in
        1971 with $250 from a savings account. To get some cash flow going while
        he developed Pong, Bushnell first started leasing pinball machines from
        other manufacturers. &quot;You can finance them with virtually nothing
        dawn,&quot; he explains, &quot;and revenues in the first few months are
        usually well above your monthly payments.&quot;</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Together
        with a consulting sideline, the pinball machines brought in about $1,000
        per month in positive cash flow, which Bushnell poured into research and
        development. And a $50,000 line of credit on receivables from Wells
        Fargo Bank's special industries group, which lends to high-technology
        companies, gave Atari the wherewithal to start manufacturing.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Bushnell
        managed to pay the bills by tracking inventories closely. &quot;With
        expensive parts, such as cabinets, we tried to get them out the same day
        they came in,&quot; he says. &quot;And we made sure that 75% of the cost
        turned over in less than a week.&quot; Atari also took advantage of the
        soaring demand for Pong by insisting on cash payments from distributors
        instead of going along with the longer terms common in the coin-operated
        game industry. Even though competitors quickly moved in, Atari was able
        to rack up sales of $3.2 million in fiscal 1973.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The
        next year, though, Bushnell learned the danger of betting a company on
        just- one product. Pong sales were dropping, forcing Atari to count
        heavily on a new race car game called Gran-Trak 10. But manufacturing
        bugs stalled production of the machine long enough to inflict a loss of
        $500,000 -- as much as the company had made the previous year. &quot;We
        cut the company back by almost half,&quot; Bushnell says, &quot;but we
        did it about three months later than we should have.&quot; As one result
        of the mishap. Bushnell turned operations over to the president of a
        subsidiary, Joseph F. Keenan. &quot;He's a brilliant hard head,&quot;
        Bushnell says of Keenan. &quot;Atari has made money in every quarter
        since he tool over.&quot;</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Getting
        Capital. The loss also started Bushnell thinking about diversification.
        &quot;We looked at both electronic pinball machines and consumer
        games,&quot; he says, &quot;and the latter turned out to be ready
        first.&quot; furthermore, Bushnell discovered, the consumer market would
        require huge cash outlays because of its seasonal nature. That meant
        increasing the capital base of the company to support the short-term
        loans it would require. &quot;We decided it was time to shore up the
        company financially and groom it for the public market,&quot; he says.
        The first step was to put together a venture capital syndicate with
        backers from various parts of the country, a job taken on by Donald
        Valentine, who heads the venture capital arms of Los Angeles-based
        Capital Research &amp; Management Corp.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">By
        the summer of 1975, Time Inc. and the California-based venture capital
        Mayfield fund had each agreed to match the $600,000 that Capital
        Research was putting into Atari, and toward the end of the year
        Valentine landed an additional $300,000 from Boston's Fidelity Venture
        Associates added to retained earnings of $2.5 million, the new money
        gave the company a capital base of about $4.5 million, enough to back
        bank lines totalling $10 million. Straining resources. Even the
        enthusiastic Valentine, however, failed to appreciate the growth
        potential in consumer games. It was far greater than Atari had bargained
        -- or capitalized -- for. &quot;The market got bigger quicker than I had
        envisioned,&quot; he says. As 1976 began, Bushnell and Valentine -- now
        on Atari's board -- began a frantic search for additional capital. But
        early optimism in discussions with potential underwriters faded along
        with the rally in the stock market. &quot;They weren't so much pushing
        the price down as wondering whether an offering could be done at
        all,&quot; Valentine says.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Meanwhile,
        the manufacturing build-up for this year's Christmas season was under
        way, and Atari was straining against its capital limitations. &quot;We
        decided that it might make sense to merge, Bushnell says, &quot;so we
        listed three companies with some synergies.&quot; One of the companies
        on the list was Warner. Capital Research Vice-President Gordon Crawford
        was acquainted with the company through Capital Research's mutual fund
        holdings of Warner stock. Crawford approached Gerard, who responded
        quickly and positively to the idea of acquiring Atari.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right:10" align="justify">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">In a
        series of negotiations over the summer, Warner soon came to terms with
        Bushnell and Valentine. The Atari negotiators were armed with a book of
        scenarios prepared by Wells Fargo's corporate finance department, which
        ran the company's prospects through a computer and came up with dozens
        of possible price ranges, based on various assumptions about Atari's
        growth and Warner’s aspirations. &quot;The $28 million price is close
        to our scenario II,&quot; says Wells Fargo Vice-President James M.
        McTaggart. &quot;That assumes an 18% annual return to Warner based on a
        20% annual growth of earnings for Atari.&quot;</font><font size="2">
